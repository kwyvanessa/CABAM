    CABAM helps users plan their grocery shopping (especially with fresh produce) by searching for and comparing recipes with the best nutrition value.

st.write(
    """
    Based on the user's ZIPCODE, CABAM searches for the closest Kroger store location and retrieves a list of vegetable products available at that location. 
    Users can choose their priority: food or budget? In either case, recipes with the best nutrition value are returned! 
    So what's the difference? Food -> top 3 cheapest vs. Budget -> cheapest fresh ingredient. 
    Using the ingredient, CABAM searches for relevant recipes from Edamam and calculates the nutrition score using the "Nutrition Score Pyramid" that is based on the recommended daily intake of each nutrient. 
    Users can then choose from the top 3 healthiest recipes and decide on serving size. 
    CABAM then extracts a list of ingredients using the ingredient-parser-nlp, determines the cheapest price and generates a grocery list for all the fresh produce needed for the recipe!

    The Nutrition Score Pyramid is developed based on the recommended daily intake (RDI) of nutrients. 
    If there is no RDI or if that value exceeds 100% (too much of a good thing? üòâ), then a negative score is assigned.
    For the remaining nutrients, a score is assigned incrementally.
